# Speed System Update - Turn Frequency Revolution

## Overview
This update transforms the speed stat from a minor combat modifier into a crucial strategic element that directly controls turn frequency in combat. Higher speed now means more turns, creating exciting new build possibilities and making speed-focused characters truly viable.

## Previous System Issues
- **Speed was nearly useless**: Only determined who went first in combat
- **No meaningful speed scaling**: Speed stat had minimal impact on gameplay
- **Boring turn-based combat**: Alternating turns regardless of character abilities
- **Wasted stat potential**: Speed builds were completely unviable
- **Limited strategic depth**: All characters fought at same pace

## New Speed-Based Turn System

### Core Mechanics
The new system uses a **turn queue** where each character's next turn is scheduled based on their speed:

```typescript
// Turn delay calculation
const calculateTurnDelay = (speed: number): number => {
  const baseDelay = 1000;
  const speedReduction = Math.min(speed * 8, 800);
  return Math.max(200, baseDelay - speedReduction);
};
```

### Speed to Turn Frequency Conversion
| Speed | Turn Delay | Turns/Second | Relative Advantage |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5     | 960ms      | 1.04         | Baseline (slow)   |
| 10    | 920ms      | 1.09         | +5%              |
| 20    | 840ms      | 1.19         | +14%             |
| 30    | 760ms      | 1.32         | +27%             |
| 50    | 600ms      | 1.67         | +60%             |
| 75    | 400ms      | 2.50         | +140%            |
| 100   | 200ms      | 5.00         | +380%            |

### Speed Sources
Characters gain speed from multiple sources:

#### Base Speed Calculation
```typescript
let speed = effectiveStats.speed; // Character's speed stat
speed += Math.floor(level * 0.5); // Level bonus
speed += Math.floor(effectiveStats.dexterity * 0.33); // Dexterity bonus
```

#### Weapon Speed Modifiers
- **One-handed weapons**: Full weapon speed bonus (×1.0)
- **Two-handed weapons**: Reduced speed bonus (×0.6) 
- **Dual-wielding**: Average weapon speeds (×0.8)
- **Shield users**: Speed penalty (-2 to -3)

#### Equipment Impact
Different weapon configurations create distinct speed profiles:
- **Dual Daggers**: Fast, consistent turns
- **Two-handed Axe**: Slow but powerful strikes
- **Sword + Shield**: Balanced, defensive pace
- **Staff**: Variable based on weapon speed

## Combat Scenarios

### Balanced Fighters (Speed 20 vs Speed 20)
- **Result**: Nearly equal turns (13 vs 12 over 10 seconds)
- **Strategy**: Traditional balanced combat
- **Best for**: New players, balanced builds

### Speed vs Tank (Speed 50 vs Speed 10)
- **Result**: 1.42:1 turn advantage to speed fighter
- **Strategy**: Speed fighter gets more attacks but tank hits harder
- **Best for**: Hit-and-run tactics, kiting strategies

### Lightning vs Turtle (Speed 100 vs Speed 5)
- **Result**: 4.64:1 turn advantage to lightning fighter
- **Strategy**: Extreme speed dominance, but turtle has massive damage per hit
- **Best for**: Glass cannon builds, extreme specialization
